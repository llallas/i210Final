## Final Project

### Project Summary

This website delves into the fascinating world of cryptids—mysterious creatures whose existence is debated, such as Bigfoot, the Loch Ness Monster, and the Chupacabra. It features in-depth profiles on legendary cryptids, eyewitness accounts, scientific theories, and cultural significance. Visitors can explore cryptid sightings, folklore, and debates about whether these creatures are real or myths.

We chose this topic because cryptids blend history, science, and storytelling, making them a compelling subject for both skeptics and believers. They also reflect human curiosity and the enduring mystery of the unknown, encouraging critical thinking about evidence, folklore, and modern myths.

### Key Takeaways

We are doing this project to help us practice using the skills we are learning in class in a real life situation. We will be working on building a website as a team, which gives us a better understanding of the workflow process as well as figuring out the best tools available to streamline the production process.

### Core Webpages

Our core webpages for our website consist of the main web page, and the individual pages for each of the different cryptids. The main page tells you what information we are sharing with the world and why it is important to us / sharing a call to action to users to be careful out there in the wild and alway keep their guard up for potentially otherworldly interactions. For our main home page, the alphabet is written across the top, and each letter takes the user to a different page with cryptids whose name starts with that letter.
For our data structure, we ended up going with a comment section for people who visit our webpage to leave comments under their favorite monsters with their own thoughts, sitings, or experiences they have witnessed with that particular cryptid. This allows engagement into the site, and gives us as cryptidologists t use this information to gauge how active a certain cryptid has been, where the sitings are occurring, and also which cryptids we should be giving our audience more information about.


### Design Choices
For the design of our website, we ended up going with an old-school computer look to our page. We have a black background with green boxy text like you might still see on really old and outdated Point of Sale systems at retail stores. This conveys to the audience a sense of eeriness as they maneuver through a dissonant experience of old code and monster on modern day technology.
