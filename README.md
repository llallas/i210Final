## Final Project

### Project Summary

This website delves into the fascinating world of cryptids—mysterious creatures whose existence is debated, such as Bigfoot, the Loch Ness Monster, and the Chupacabra. It features in-depth profiles on legendary cryptids, eyewitness accounts, scientific theories, and cultural significance. Visitors can explore cryptid sightings, folklore, and debates about whether these creatures are real or myths.

We chose this topic because cryptids blend history, science, and storytelling, making them a compelling subject for both skeptics and believers. They also reflect human curiosity and the enduring mystery of the unknown, encouraging critical thinking about evidence, folklore, and modern myths.
